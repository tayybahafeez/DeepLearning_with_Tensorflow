# TensorFlow Projects - MobileNet CNN and LSTM/RNN Models

Welcome to my repository where I showcase my work on deep learning projects using TensorFlow.

## ðŸ§  Projects Overview

### 1. **MobileNet CNN Model for Image Classification**
In this project, I used TensorFlow to build and train a **MobileNet** model for image classification. The model is pre-trained on a large dataset and fine-tuned on a custom dataset (like the TensorFlow Flowers dataset) to recognize different categories of flowers.

**Key Features**:
- Pre-trained MobileNet model for transfer learning
- Fine-tuned to achieve higher accuracy on a custom dataset
- Model evaluation and prediction
- Data augmentation techniques for better generalization

**Technologies**:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- ImageDataGenerator (for data augmentation)
- TensorFlow Datasets (for loading datasets)

### 2. **LSTM/RNN Models for Sequential Data**
Currently, I am working on building **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** and **RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)** models for tasks such as time series forecasting and sequence prediction.

**Key Features**:
- LSTM and RNN model architectures for sequence processing
- Applications in NLP, time series forecasting, and text generation
- Model training and evaluation using custom datasets
- Hyperparameter tuning for better performance

**Technologies**:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Numpy
- Pandas
